SEm personal ram init file
==========================

copy the files with your name to

    SEm_labs/Simulation

make a copy and rename them to

    ramXInit.txt
    ramYInit.txt

(maybe you have to delete the exitings files first)

change the constants 

    patternAddressBitNb
    curvePointNb

in your VHDL code to the values given in the filename

    _<patternAddressBitNb>for<curvePointNb>_

verify that the constant

    curvePointNb

has a value of about 20
